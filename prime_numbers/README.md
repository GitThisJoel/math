# Prime Numbers

The *exercis* in `prime.py` is based on the first chapter, titled *Prime Numbers*, in the book *PROJECTS FOR SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING IN C++ AND
OTHER LANGUAGES* by Victor Eijkhout, and can be found [here](file:///home/joel/code/EijkhoutProgrammingProjects-book.pdf).

Thanks to Mr. Eijkhout.
